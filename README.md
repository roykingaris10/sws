Project Structure

Below is a brief overview of the scripts located in the src/systems folder:

boost-shop.lua: Handles the in‑game purchase logic for speed, jump, coin, and other boosts via RemoteEvents and DataStore.

redeem-codes.lua: Manages Twitter or event redemption codes, validates them, and awards players accordingly, tracking one‑time use per player.

level-system.lua: Implements the leveling progression, experience tracking, milestone rewards, and persistence via DataStore.

(Each script includes a top‑level documentation block describing its purpose and usage.)
